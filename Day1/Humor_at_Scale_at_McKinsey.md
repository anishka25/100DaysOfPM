# Humor at Scale: Shifting Global Culture at McKinsey & Co
### June 6, 2022 : Global Partner conference that showcased the culture of humour at McKinsey
- Dubai Based Associate Partner - Mohmmad Al-Moumen (Main character)
- Golbal Managing Partner - Bob Sternfels
- Moumen had created some clips (created during the pandemic) that featured fake zoom conversations using edited footage from Bob's virtual town halls and jokingly commented on his baldness and mimicked various hairstyles of past McKinsey leaders.
- Sternfels embraced the joke and started the Global Partner Conference with those clips to encourage this type of humour.

> In 24 months Moumen's life shifted from Virtual office meeting to standups and regional meetings to global conferences and even reached client works.
This humour reached across geographies and garnered support from the firm.

### Initial Stage : Humour during the pandemic
- 24 months earlier, In april 2020.
-  To connect the employees (especially the newly recruited ones) working at McKinsey who had never met each other.Comedy night was organised.
- Moumen decided to pitch in the last moment, which was a 23 min setup , which picked up both laughter and akward silences. 
- His comedy set focused on the day-to-day lived realities of consultants in the Middle East, which was popularised on Instagram (trending).
- Al-Moumen mined what he-and his audience—knew and appreciated.

- After almost a year, when the second comedy night was hosted. Al was asked to host it. 
-  In order to remove the akward silences during the comedy when others were on mute he decided to switch to a video format.
- Over the course of eight weeks and with the firm’s approval, Al-Moumen worked with
McKinsey’s IT and communications teams to collect all of the office’s recorded virtual
townhalls, timestamping everything that was said and logging over a thousand lines of quotes on
Excel spreadsheets. In these videos, he acted as an
interviewer, asking the partners various questions and then cutting to clips of them speaking at
the virtual townhalls, editing together responses taken completely out of context.
- He recieved a lot of praise and appreciation from the senior partners, in front of the entire office which motivated him.

### Starting Bosses Sippin’ Vosses
- For the next evolution of humour at McKinsey, Al was inspired by comedy series like Between Two Ferns (with Zach Galifianakis), Carpool Karaoke
(James Corden), and Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee (Jerry Seinfeld), which were popular in middle east despite having roots in american tv. He decided to create his own version called Bosses Sippin’ Vosses, where he would invite senior managers at McKinsey while driving and drinking voss-branded water.
-  Inviting senior leaders showed their credibilty but also showed their unseen and friendly side to juniors.
- He would talk about things which are hard to say in day to day life, in a humorous manner.

### Maintaining respect and boundary
- Moumen unlike other stand up comedians did not have the luxury to practice his sets. He relied on a small group of people to preview his contend and ensure -
    - appropriateness
    - inclusivity 
    - cultural relevance 
- He made sure that the content was not selected on the basis of " will this make people laugh" but was decided based on " will this make the people at Mckinsey feel joyful and safe" and " will this humaize the leadership"
- To ensure appropraiteness he always decided to punch up—that is,
make fun of senior colleagues—and he relied on local cultural norms to inform how to approach
sensitive topics to show the non-hierarchial nature at McKinsey.
- Seniors described his content as edgy but never crossing the line.
- He played with formats and styles to find what suited him the best and deliver content consistently.

### Scaling up
- February 2022:EEMA Leadership Summit Abu Dhabi
- Al-Moumen was asked to host the first in-person gathering of colleagues in the region since the pandemic.
- Given the greater scale, Al-Moumen had to reimagine the content that resonated.
- made a Venn diagram :  what worked in Dubai,
what would work globally, and what overlapped
- mined regional all-hands meetings for moments that were
generic enough for everyone to understand, focusing in particular on the senior leadership that
everyone in the audience worked with. 
- he was careful to avoid slang terms, region-specific words (unless it was part of the joke). 
- McKinsey then analyzed the post-summit survey responses from hundreds of attendees. Of the
entire two-day conference program, Al-Moumen’s performance was rated the highest of any
session.

### Marvin studios
- Al-Moumen decided to brand the comedy content as “Marvin Studios” and created a slack group (#marvin-studios), giving the content a name communicated a shared purpose and direction.
- As his content started getting recognition, he started getting calls from senior leaders to be invited.
- The comedy skits and roasts had become a powerful force for humanization within the firm, helping coworkers
understand the people behind the titles, even in a socially distanced world.

### Going Global
- 2022: McKinsey was giving comedy a global stage.
- Global Managing Partner Bob Sternfels invited Al-Moumen to create
material for : the Global
Partner Conference.
- Over the course of 3 months , utilizing the budget and resources, the team interviewed senior members and created content with right tone and style.
- Al-Moumen relied on tried-and-true formats and processes to
maximize the chances of success, focusing just on scaling the breadth of his content for this
global stage. 
- And on stage in Montreal, on screens above Sternfels’
head, the videos played to rapturous laughter.


### The next generation of leaders
- Following the Global Partner Conference, the McKinsey leadership considered how
to formalize Marvin Studios as an in-house global studio. 
- Al-Moumen and the McKinsey leadership then set their sights on the most important frontier:
serving clients. They saw how levity was helping to shape culture within the firm and were
convinced that other companies could benefit from a similar approach.
- A number of partners took Al-Moumen up on the offer.


### Challenges
<details><summary>How could he continue
scaling the comedy work globally?</summary>
The best way to keep scaling the comedy work is to provide it to the clients as humour in the workplace training or interactive workshops with role playing and fun group discussions. To make sure that it can be adapted globally it is to be ensured that the McKinsey with Marvin studios can inspire other firms globally to take up humour in way that creates a sense of safety and one-ness among the team and ensure that humour is inclusive and appropriate.As the clients from everywhere see the impact of comedy, it will automatically scale up. We can measure the success of this by client surveys, productivity levels, team interactions, etc. </details>

### 

<details><summary>What would success look like for Marvin Studios, and how
would he set the project up to achieve it?</summary> The best way to measure impact in this case is to see the response at  individual, organisational, global and client level. Positive feedback and more approachability among and employees at individual level. Increase in productivity at organisational level. Adoption of humour as an important aspect of an organisations with trainings and team building at global level. Positive Client feedbacks and increase in requests for humour for team building from McKinsey or Marvin studios. These all could measure the success the of Marvin studios. To set up the project there should be a dedicated team within the organisation and in order to scale it globally the content should be based beyond Mckinsey. </details>

### 

<details><summary>How might he continue building his skillset as a
consultant while balancing this passion project—and stay on track for the partner role? </summary>With support from McKinsey itself Moumen can balance his work as a consultant while integrating humour into consulting, through team building workshops, leadership training and workshops etc. He could also take up public speaking to keep his passion alive and impact a larger audience at the same time. Delegating people for the data collection, joke writing etc. should be done so that his passion project can continue, even when he is busy with his consulting commitments. This can come in handy for client projects as well, since there will be a team working on this instead of a single person. To maintain a balance between everything he must maintain clear schedules but should keep his passion for humour alive by making it a part of his job as a consultant, this not only impacts his happiness and motivation but also creates a new layer to build leadership in corporate culture.</details>

<details><summary>How could McKinsey bring this new capability to the clients it served, empowering them and
transforming their companies in joyful, humanizing, and valuable ways?</summary>McKinsey can work with Marvin Studios to build a seperate service that can offer special leadership trainings , workshops and team building exercises to bring their team closer and together. They could also provide the clients with humorous ideas for their client's products so that it makes them accessible and interesting to the general public,this could be an innovative way to campaign the products for the clients and the public, creating a USP for McKinsey to its clients. This approach will not only transform the work culture at clients firms but also impact their audiences globally.</details>
