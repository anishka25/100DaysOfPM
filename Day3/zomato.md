# ZOMATO PM Questions

[1] There has been a sudden spike in partial order delivery complaints by users on Zomato. How would you solve it?
</summary>
The recent spike in partial order deliveries could be due to various factors, including increased order loads on restaurants, inefficiencies among delivery partners, or even a system bug. To identify the root cause, we should conduct a user survey asking whether their orders were delivered incomplete. This data will help us determine if the issue is concentrated around specific restaurants, linked to certain delivery partners (which can be verified through app data), or if it appears random, indicating a potential system bug.

To address this issue effectively, we can implement a QR code system that delivery partners must scan when collecting orders from restaurants. This will ensure that the number of packed items matches the number ordered, reducing the chances of missing items. Additionally, delivery partners should be required to confirm that all items are delivered.

If the issue stems from a system bug, we can analyze patterns related to food categories, ordering processes, and payment methods to pinpoint and resolve the problem.

From a customer service perspective, immediate refunds should be provided for undelivered items, along with additional coupons as a goodwill gesture and an apology for the inconvenience. Encouraging users to opt for tamper-proof packaging will also add an extra layer of accountability for delivery partners and enhance customer trust.

[2] How would you improve the Zomato app?
</summary>
We can implement an AI-based recommendation system that suggests restaurants and dishes based on user preferences, past orders, and location and add personalized discount and promotion offers for users based on their ordering habits, increasing user retention.
I would add the feature to let the users add photo-based reviews that allow users to upload images of their food, helping others get a clearer picture of what they can expect.
I feel for group orders we can also add the functionality to let the multiple users add items to the same order and split the bill on the app itself. We can also increase zomato's functionality by adding the feature where users can order from multiple places in a single order, for distances upto 2km the distance fee can be the same as that for one order and for orders placed upto 5km distance we can add extra delivery fee and for longer than 5km we can also assign a seperate delivery partner along with additional fee, this will save time for users and will also be a more eco-friendly and time saving option.
For our trusted customers and frequent buyers we can add a loyalty program where users can earn points for each order, which can be redeemed for discounts, free delivery, or exclusive offers. This encourages repeat business.For preventing fraud detection in this scenario we can let the delivery partner verify the order which if verified will earn the points for the customer.

[3] How would you increase ratings of restaurants for dining and deliveries?
</summary>
To encourage user reviews for restaurants and food deliveries, we can implement several strategies. For restaurant reviews, users can be incentivized with special gift coupons for different brands upon submitting a review. For food deliveries, a notification can be triggered after the order has been delivered and likely consumed, increasing the chances of users providing feedback while their experience is still fresh. While writing reviews, users can be presented with predefined tags such as “Good Quality Food” or “Proper Packaging,” making the process easier and more structured. Additionally, a visual bar can track and display the most commonly selected tags, allowing other users to quickly assess a restaurant’s strengths. This interactive feature will not only encourage more reviews but also make users feel that their feedback directly impacts the restaurant’s rating. To further enhance engagement, we can introduce photo reviews, as they are quicker to add and provide potential customers with a clear visual expectation of the food quality.

[4] Does it make sense for Zomato to allow users to order from multiple restaurants in a single order? If yes, how would you implement it? If not, why?
</summary>
I feel that it is a great idea to let the users order from multiple places at the same time this would not only save users time and be a more feasible option for consumers but will also be a sustainable option. This can also benefit zomato as they wont have to emply seperate delivery partners for nearbly places. For distances upto 2km the distance fee can be the same as that for one order and for orders placed upto 5km distance we can add extra delivery fee and for longer than 5km we can also assign a seperate delivery partner along with additional fee. Since picking up orders from diffrent locations will increase the delivery time we can show the estimated delivery time to the user and then can let the user to chose to order them seperately with more delivery fee or chose order them in the same cart with more delivery time. This will be an effective way to get survey the user interest as well and the further app developments can also benefit from the user choice ie money or time. We can use AI to find optimised routes between restaurants.

[5] Design a new feature for Zomato that could help users choose healthier dining options. Walk us through your design process.
</summary>
On opening the app we should display banners of restaurants which are offering healthy dishes at discounted prices.We should create a category for everyday food for those who eat out on a regular basis and need healthier food options. We should also add an option of mentioning the calories in every food order to make the user more informed about the products they are buying. On the cart also there should be a total calories field to let the user know about the total calories being consumed in the whole order, this will make users more mindful of their consumption. We can also use AI to suggest healthier food alternatives as Recommendations for the users based on their choices.These suggestions can appear subtly within the menu or as part of the checkout process, so they don't overwhelm the user but encourage healthier selections when needed.

[6] How can Zomato create a monetizable data product for restaurants? Create the entire go-to-market plan for the same.
</summary>
We can create a personalised dashboard for each restaurant showing it a detailed analysis of the most frequqntly ordered dishes , most disliked dishes, estimated delivery time for their orders to be delivered, average sales, along with dine in reservations made, coupons used , graph of sales with coupons and AI suggestions using competitor analysis through publicly available data and use of AI, this ensures that each restaurant can maintain the privacy of their restaurant and use these insights to make better business decisions and drive sales. To sell this data stream to the restaurants , we can create a marketing campaign for this, since the go-to-market for this is intially the existing restaurants on zomato I would like to create a pop up video and a banner video introducing our datastream on the restaurant dashboard. The dashboard should display various features which can only be unlocked after they purchase the premium subscription to getter better insights.The design of the dashboard will be kept simple and intuitive so that the features are easily accessible along with an info button for each feature which will describe what that feature is for, we will also provide customer support.We can brand it by saying "know your customers and competitors better , drive more sales". We will assert that the privacy and data of each restaurant will be secured and will not be disclosed to any third party. Success can be measured by the monthly adoption rates and quaterly retention rate analysis.

[7] How would you redesign Zomato's app so that it targets business lunches?
</summary>
We can create a specific feature called business lunches on Zomato which will ask the user how fancy the place needs to be. Then on the basis of the option chosen by the user we can show tailored restaurants with only more than 4 star reviews. We can add multiple users to add the dishes to the same order and split the bill. The recommendations also needs to be sorted in the fastest to slowest delivery time, this will help to make the business desicions faster. We can also add a business favorites category so that users can chose restaurants that are already preferred by other business for lunches , and add the option to let the user make reservations or place the order before hand for the group according to set timing, this will ensure a hassle free meal.

[8] What would be your approach to launching Zomato in a new country?
</summary>
First would be to do consumer and producer survey. Study local consumer preferences, dining habits, and competition. Understand which cuisines are popular, dining behavior, and whether users prefer delivery or dine-in. I would also study if the restaurants in the past have used this kind of food delivery platform, did they like it, what issues did they face, do they  have any doubts regarding this, to make sure that the both the users are willing to use platform once it starts. I would then cater to demands and earlier issues faced and modify the platform to  suit the needs of both sides. Then I would first deliver a beta version of the modified platform with changed language preferences and UI and communicate with the customers to understand them better. After the review and analysis , I would launch Zomato in the new country to make sure it doesnt fail. I would then collaborate with local food bloggers and influencers to describe their experience after ordering from Zomato and encourage the restaurants to brand that they are now available on zomato, I feel branding can be done by saying " your favourite restaurant at your finger tips". This will give the consumers a sense of relief and importance. Initially I would also launch with discounts and coupons to garner consumer trust. I would set up a customer support to attend to both the restaurants and the consumers.
