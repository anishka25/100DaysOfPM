What would you suggest a new company intersted in getting into the rideshare business? List the metrics you would track?
</summary>
For a company entering the rideshare business, the first step is to identify its target audience and define a unique value proposition along with competitive pricing that sets it apart from existing competitors. Understanding the technology stack, business model, and timeline for launch is crucial for ensuring scalability. Initially, the focus should be on customer satisfaction and feedback, refining the product based on real-world usage before expanding. A strong branding and marketing strategy, combined with seamless customer support and driver onboarding, will help in early adoption. Key metrics to track include customer retention rate, acquisition cost, net profit per customer, ride completion rate, and growth by area to identify high-performing markets especially the under served ones. By iterating based on data and maintaining open communication between drivers and riders, the company can optimize operations and establish a strong foothold in the rideshare industry.

How would you design a TV remote for older people
</summary>
The first thing I would like to address while creating a TV remote for older people would be simplicity, I would like to create a TV remote with as little buttons as possible including home, power, voice and  navigation buttons I would like to add voice fucntionality for other features like playing a certain channel or changing the brightness of the screen and being able to mute and unmute with just voice command.The buttons should be large and high contrast for easy navigation. Then in order to find the remote easily I would like to add the functionality that the remote rings and vibrates when called. I would like to add a comfortable grip and lightweight design to enhance usability further.A rechargeable dock or long battery life would prevent frequent battery changes and would make it more comfortable and hassle free to use.

How would you design a water bottle? What parameteres would you use to evaluate and perform quality testing of the bottle?
</summary>
The bottle should have an easy grip and be temperature-resistant, with the functionality to set and maintain the desired temperature of the liquid. I would also like to add a suction base to prevent the bottle from falling easily. Additionally, a digital screen should be included to track the amount of liquid consumed, helping users monitor their water intake.
The bottle should have a built-in filter that not only removes harmful chemicals and dirt but also preserves essential minerals. I would also like to incorporate a tea-making function, allowing users to brew tea directly in the bottle, as the tea leaves can be easily filtered. This feature would make the bottle both travel-friendly and multi-purpose.
For convenience, the bottle should have plug-in charging to eliminate the hassle of changing batteries.
For quality testing, I would first check the durability and lifespan of the bottle. I would then assess its insulation, spill-proof design, and temperature maintenance efficiency, along with the time required to reach the desired temperature.

Design a system for car parking which helps users find the available spots easily.
</summary>
Car parking should have a screen that scans the car model and its car number to automatically note the car license plate and its entry time and alot a parking space to it dynamically that make sures that the nearest empty parking space and other cars in the space which can also the cars to exit efficiently too for example if there are already big cars in a space then a smaller can be alloted to that section, along with a option to suggest another option to the driver so that if he/she feels unsatisfied with the parking floor or space he can ask the system to suggest another one. There can be special provision for EV vehicles and emergency parkings, if needed.
The system should have a list of all the car parking spots marked by color and pillar number and section number for easy categorisation.We can install smart cameras for each lot containing about 50 cars in a section and the AI can scan the cars for their alloted space and enable the driver to park the car in the alloted space, these spaces can get locked after the driver removes the car from the parking space.There can be a security alert to the driver if he/she parks in the restricted spot.
This way most of the space is used in each lot and will enable a more quick and secure access to the parking spaces without the rush to secure a spot.While exiting the AI can easily calculate the exit time of the cars and give slips for the amount to be paid before exiting.
