# OYO's customer satisfaction score has dropped by 15% in Jaipur (Root cause analysis)

### Identify the metrics for customer satisfaction
First we identify what metrics are being used to define the decline in customer satisfaction. Like, customer service, room booking, room service, payment issues etc.

### Has the decline been sudden or gradual?
Then we evaluate if the decline seen is calculated over some time or now or has it been sudden. If the decline has been gradual then the change may have been as a result of customer needs and the overall management depending on the impact of internal and external changes and if the change has been sudden then it may be due to change in the current trends and events taking place.

### Demographic breakdown
Break down the changes to more in-depth demographics, which customer is majorly showing the dissatisfaction and which area is impacted. Has there been decline in satisfaction for a particular type of rooms. Was decline majorly in online booked rooms or in-person booking.

### Internal factors
- Has there been any major changes in the company management
- Any new policies formed
- New changes made on website
- Asking the local management and teams along with customer reviews can give a detailed insight on the internally influencing factors.
- If internal changes (e.g., website updates, policy shifts) are a cause, we can run usability tests or roll back recent changes to evaluate their impact

### External factors
- Any new event major to Jaipur
- Any changes in the customer sentiment in Jaipur towards OYO
- Seasonal changes
- After evaluating the changes that might be affecting this, schemes can be launched and offer a cheaper price for the slow times for OYO.
- For upcoming major events, introducing group booking discounts could improve customer satisfaction.
- We can keep a track of what major events impact the sales and timely offer discounts through an iterative approach and modify them on the basis of customer outreach and increase in sales accoding to previous times, along with measuring the NPS score and customer feedback.


Depending on what is impacting the customer satisfaction and measuring it with any major changes made internal to the organisation and evaluating the external factors can give us a better evaluation of the current changes and will help us to take appropriate measures.
