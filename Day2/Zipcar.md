# Robin Chase, Zipcar, and an Inconvenient Discovery

### About Chase
- Chase spent the majority of her childhood in the
Middle East with stints in Swaziland and Washington, DC.
- Her childhood had a significant impact
on the business leader she grew to become. She learned, the importance of respecting all
people, regardless of income and skill levels from her father and the ability to build something useful from whatever was avaialble from her mother. 
- Upon graduating, one of Chase’s first
jobs was at John Snow Inc. (JSI), a public health research and consulting startup, where she was
project administrator for several United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
contracts.
- She decided she wanted to go to business school so she could run these
big projects with a business school background.
- After retaking the GMAT exam to get into MIT sloan,she was admitted to the class of 1996 and was among 32 women out of 220 students.
- Chase’s focus on math did not end with the GMAT or with her acceptance to MIT Sloan. She was
committed to mastering finance, knowing that it would serve her later on.
- She hadn’t taken math since she had been in 11th grade. But with her commitment she studied so hard for it that in the final exam she got an A. It was  a demonstration to her that she can master any subject.
- During an orientation exercise Subarctic Survival Situation, the students had to list the 15 items recovered from the crashed plane in the order of importance for their survival.
- Chase's ranking differed from her classmates and she decided to concede only to find out that her ranking was correct and realised an important lesson that "Some times you are right and really have to fight for it."


### The beginning of idea 
- Chase had realised by 1999 that she wanted to do something that had real tangible value and not just monetary value.
- One day while having coffee with her friend , Antje Danielson, a
geochemist who worked for the University Committee on Environment at Harvard University, told
her about a car-sharing business she had learned about during a recent visit to Berlin, Germany.
- Chase was so inspired by this idea that she decided to create a car sharing business herself.
- She thought that internet was made for the purpose of sharing a very specific resource among people and decided to utilise wireless technology because it held tremendous promise for what it would
enable a car-sharing startup to do, namely allow reservations and usage data to be seamlessly
communicated among the cars, the company, and the users.
- At first glance, the percentage of adults
who regularly used the Internet in the United States (46%8
), owned cell phones (just over 53%9
), and
used the Internet wirelessly (0%10) suggested that Chase faced a steep uphill climb in her quest to
build an Internet- and wireless-driven company. However, she knew these usage percentages were
changing by the day, particularly in a technology-centric city like Boston. She believed the time was
right for car sharing in the United States.
- Chase also found this idea illuminating as she had 3 kids and her husband took the car to work, but on certain occasions when she needed a car she knew that she didn’t need or want one full
time. She was embarking on building a company with her own lifestyle in mind.
- Within days of their initial conversation over coffee, Chase and Danielson shook hands, agreeing to a
50-50 ownership of the company that eventually became Zipcar.

### The next step
- Upon deciding to start a car-sharing venture, one of Chase’s first phone calls was to her brother Mark,
who lived in Portland, Maine. After earning his master’s degree in urban and environmental policy
from Tufts University, Mark Chase founded and led the Seaport Transportation Management
Association (Seaport TMA) in Boston. The Seaport TMA worked with large companies like Gillette
and Fidelity to find ways for their employees to get to work in a more sustainable way. Chase knew
Mark was familiar with car sharing and that he would be a gold mine of advice on whom to talk to.
- Her list of whom to talk to was long and included
policymakers in the cities of Boston and Cambridge, owners of parking lots, owners of land upon
which parking lots sat, car manufacturers, car rental companies, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), engineers, academics, entrepreneurs, and, of course, investors. 
- She also contacted Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), which was running a pilot study looking at the
environmental impact of selling auto insurance by the mile. It was through the CLF that Chase met
Peter Nessen. A member of the CLF’s board, Nessen was a public accountant who had been the chief
financial officer of former Massachusetts Governor William Weld’s cabinet during the early 1990s.
He lived on Beacon Hill and did not own a car. 
- Soon after meeting him, Nessen became one of
Chase’s most trusted advisers, advising her on budgeting, cash flow, and financial models.
- One key industry contact Chase made during the exploration phase, and who was not a dead end, was
Benoît Robert. In 1994, Robert founded Communauto, a car-sharing company based in Montreal,
Canada. Knowing there were a number of other car-sharing organizations operating in Europe and
two new companies in the United States—Portland CarSharing, which launched in 1998, and
Seattle’s Flexcar, which would launch a few months ahead of Zipcar—Chase honed in on learning
about Communauto. After fifteen years of operation, it was the largest car-sharing organization in
North America, with 1,300 members sharing 50 cars in Montreal and another 700 members sharing
40 cars in Quebec City.11
- Chase’s visit with Robert proved to be very valuable. She was struck by how open and generous he
was with sharing his learnings about the business as well as company financials. Chase came away
from her visit with two key observations about Communauto’s business model: first, the company
was primarily paper-driven and was not harnessing technology in any way. Reservations, for instance,
were taken over the phone and written down in pencil in the company’s ledger. Second, all cars had
the same price, which proved problematic in the area of the city where parking was most expensive
and where demand was highest. Due to the parking expense, Communauto placed fewer vehicles in
these areas and, as a result, failed to meet demand. Chase recognized that this was a not a model she
wanted to replicate.
- On her networking and learning tour, Chase heard words of criticism and doubt about the car-sharing
concept. It was no secret that profitability had eluded many car-sharing organizations (CSOs) in the
past. The high cost of overhead, cars, insurance, and parking spots were largely to blame. 
- The car rental companies didn’t think Chase would be able to scale the business due to the fact that
her car purchases would be in such small volume.
- Fred Salvucci, the former secretary of
transportation for Massachusetts and a lecturer at MIT specializing in urban transportation planning,
and from whom Chase sought advice, worried that the rental companies would get into the carsharing business. (In May 2000, Hertz launched a “shared-car” pilot program in San Francisco. For
less than $400 a month, “subscribers” had access to a fleet of Ford Escorts parked at a rapid-transit
station.)
- Chase was able to tune out the critics and naysayers, firmly believing there was market demand and
that wireless technology would help put the concept of car sharing in the black. It was clear to her that
she would be able to launch a car-sharing business with few employees. Zipcar’s first investor, Jean
Hammond, who gave Chase a $50,000 convertible loan in February 2000, was also a believer.

### Putting it together 
- “Zipcar, Inc.” was incorporated in January 2000 with Chase taking the title of CEO and Danielson,
vice president. 
- In choosing the company name, Chase turned to her potential customers. Without
saying anything about the car-sharing venture she was putting together, Chase would stop strangers
on the streets of Cambridge and Boston and ask them to say what came to mind when they saw the
following words: Wheelshare, U.S. Car Share, and Zipcar. She discovered that 40% of people didn’t
like the word “share” and Wheelshare made many people think of wheelchair. Zipcar ended up being
the hands-down winner, and, best of all, the URL wasn’t taken.
- Chase got to work building a team to help develop technology and get Zipcar’s operations up and
running. While involved with the technology and operations part of the business, the majority of
Chase’s time was spent raising money, writing and designing the website, and determining a pricing
model for the business. 
- As with any startup, no task fell in a particular order or could be tackled
linearly. 

### Team
- Zipcar had immediate access to automotive expertise through Danielson, who had experience in semiconductors, car sales, and repairs. However, her involvement was limited as she worked full-time at Harvard, contributing mainly on nights and weekends.
- Chase’s husband Roy Russell, an electrical engineer from MIT who worked at a technology company
managing the development of speech recognition applications, was on hand to help Chase during the
evenings and on the weekends. Russell set up the company’s server and eventually spent a lot of time
working on in-car technology. (His role at the company became permanent in the fall of 2000.)
- Due to his vast network and knowledge about transportation policy and the industry, Chase’s brother
Mark focused on business development.
- Stephen Oakley and Larry Slotnick were two key additions Chase made to the Zipcar team during its
early days. Both were hired as “consultants” and were paid by the hour for the first few months they
were with the company. Chase felt it was important to “try” before she “bought.” 
- When Chase first approached him about working for Zipcar, Oakley was the business manager of
clinical operations at Cambridge Health Alliance. When Oakley heard Chase’s idea for car sharing,
he thought she was insane. However, despite
the career risk Oakley was taking, Chase’s passion and commitment to initiate something new won
him over. Oakley focused on operations. (He eventually became the
director of Boston operations.)
- When Chase’s brother Mark first approached Larry Slotnick, whom he knew through the
Massachusetts Bicycle Coalition, about joining the Zipcar team, Slotnick was serving as the
coalition’s interim director.Slotnick shifted his professional focus toward marketing
after earning his MBA. Like Oakley, Slotnick found Chase’s vision to create something brand-new to
be inspiring and infectious. Due to his love of biking, Chase tapped him to be the person to pick up
and move cars and service them. The easiest way to do this was to travel from car to car on bicycle. If
a car had to be moved, Slotnick would simply put his bike in the back, eliminating the need for a
second driver. (Shortly after Zipcar’s launch, Slotnick became fleet manager.)
- In addition, Chase hired various hourly paid consultants and engineers to
work on specific aspects of the company. One of Chase’s later additions to the Zipcar team came in
May, one month before Zipcar launched, when, on the advice of several advisers who felt the
company needed someone with corporate experience to bring credibility to the management team,
Chase hired Keefer Welch as president.
- Welch came from the hotel industry where he held several upper-management positions in a number
of different cities across the United States. In his role, he was responsible for business execution,
leaving Chase to be the visionary. Welch’s tenure at Zipcar lasted three months. His firing incensed one investor who dropped his $200,000 commitment in Zipcar to $50,000.


### About technology 
- Due to the nascent stage of wireless technology in early 2000, Chase’s desire to build a system
whereby the company’s cars and server could seamlessly communicate proved very complicated, and
required many iterations and engineers.
-  She wanted something simpler, something with fewer steps, something that would
be ready for wireless technologies that were becoming more sophisticated and reliable by the day.
Thanking the engineering firm for their work, Chase turned to Russell who brought in a couple of
engineering students from MIT.
Russell and the students set out to develop a simpler, wireless-ready system, with hardware that was
equipped with a wireless modem. Because it was going to take some time to develop the software that
would enable cars to talk to the company’s servers, the first Zipcars were equipped with readers that
were unable to recognize the unique number printed on the back of each member’s Zipcard.
- Initially, any Zipcard could unlock any Zipcar, posing a security risk, but the team saw it as low-risk due to the small user base. They prioritized ensuring doors always unlocked for customers rather than delaying the launch for better security.
- On the operational side, the leasing of cars, securing of parking places, buying of insurance, and
setting up of a credit card system took significantly more time than Chase anticipated largely due to
Zipcar’s untested business model. In leasing cars, Chase crafted specific talking points to use when
meeting with car manufacturers to ensure they didn’t think of Zipcar as a potential disrupter to their
business. Chase created a one-page description for car manufacturers explaining Zipcar, the service it
provided, and how it would positively impact them.
- She would tell them that she could make more of their constituents car satisfied with
fewer cars and fewer parking spots but the companies told her that they would put out a request for a proposal, They did an RFP for car sharing, which
meant anyone could bid on it. No one applied but her.It took nearly six months from start
to finish.
- Securing insurance was a costly endeavor due to the untested idea of car sharing.
Fortunately, Chase was able to make the process of identifying an insurer easier by finding out the
name of the company that was insuring Portland CarSharing and Flexcar. While the insurer’s rates
were high, as she expected them to be, and the customer service substandard. She
knew that within a year the company would be in a better position to negotiate rates with insurance
companies. 


### Funding
- Unfortunately, Chase’s timing for fundraising was not ideal. While the previous two years saw
investors throw hundreds of millions of dollars at companies with unclear and in some cases nonexistent business models, Chase began fundraising in early 2000 as the dot.com bubble of the late
1990s began to collapse. Between February and May 2000, the NASDAQ dropped 28%.
- On top of the challenges that Chase faced looking for money in a falling market, she found herself
contending with an investor mindset that was still in the “bubble”, where they expected 30 times their investment in the falling maket as well.And it took a long time for them to recalibrate to be more serious.
- Before Zipcar's launch, Chase attended over 100 fundraising meetings with investors and VCs but struggled to secure any investments despite promises of interest.
- Three days before Zipcar’s launch, Chase faced an unexpected demand for $21,000 in security deposits for leased cars, with only $68 left from the initial investment. At a startup event, she urgently requested $25,000 from angel investor Juan Enriquez, who immediately agreed, enabling Zipcar to secure the needed cars and move forward with the launch.

### Pricing Model
- Relying on her well-honed finance background, Chase attacked the pricing challenge. Fortunately,
she had access to pricing models used by Communauto and a number of European car-sharing
companies, with an online presence, as a starting point. 
- Chase eventually settled on a pricing model common to those companies beginning with a security
deposit of $300 and an annual membership fee of $50. The membership fee was meant to cover the
costs of processing the driving background checks, the Zipcard, marketing and include some profit.
(The $50 fee allowed Chase room to discount the membership fee for employees and students from
places like Harvard and MIT, an unexpectedly strategic pricing decision she was not shy to call
“brilliant.”) 
- The per-mile and per-hour usage rates fell into two categories: renting a “regular” car like
a Volkswagen Beetle cost $4.50 an hour and $0.40 a mile, while a “premium” car like a Volkswagen
Passat was $7.00 an hour and $0.40 a mile. For all car types, the daily rate was $44 for up to 125
miles, after which each mile was $0.18. 
- Chase wanted the hourly and daily rates to cover fixed costs (parking spots, depreciation on the car,
insurance), while the mileage cost was to cover the variable cost (maintenance and fuel).



### Hitting the Road
- Zipcar launched in June 2000 with a fleet of four Volkswagens. The cars were parked along four
contiguous subway stops along the Red Line (Charles/MGH, Kendall, Central, and Harvard). 
- Right at its launch, Zipcar got national media attention when an Associated Press reporter spotted its branded car in Boston and wrote a story about the service, which was published on June 23.
-  The main message Chase wanted to send was that Zipcar was “smart,” “urban,” and “hip,” and it was not
the poor man’s car.
- The
main message Chase wanted to send was that Zipcar was “smart,” “urban,” and “hip,” and it was not
the poor man’s car.21 The company relied heavily on guerilla-style, hyper-local marketing to get the
word out. Chase had hundreds of postcards printed advertising Zipcar’s service that were handed out
to people on the street, particularly those emerging from the subway.

### Customer Experience 
- Becoming a member of Zipcar entailed filling out an application and paying the accompanying $25
fee. All members had to be over 21 years old. Before being allowed to reserve cars, new members
had to attend an in-person orientation during which they were shown how to open car doors using
their Zipcard and use the fuel card to fill the gas tank when it got below a quarter of a tank.
- Members were required to fill out time slips each
time they rented a car, recording their start and stop time and the odometer’s start and stop mileage.
Slips were kept in the glove compartment in all cars. Once a month, staff would collect the time slips
from the cars and Chase would manually enter usage data into an Excel spreadsheet and bill members
accordingly. 
- From the very beginning, communicating directly with Zipcar’s members was very important to
Chase. As she explained, it was important for her to give customers a sense of the Zipcar brand and
culture and who was behind the company.
22 She wanted to instill a strong sense of trust between the
company and its customers. Every 3 or 4 weeks she would even send out mails to her customers sometimes even nagging about filling the gas tank , to give a sense of "this was more than just a business" to her customers.
- It was through her close contact with members that Chase learned about their dislike of Zipcar’s twotiered pricing model. Members would get frustrated when the less expensive “regular” cars were
unavailable and, therefore, were forced to reserve one of the “premium” cars.
- She opted to
replace the two-tiered pricing model with one in which each and every car had its own price
depending on where it was parked and what type of a car it was. 
- Complaints about pricing aside, the overall feedback from members was positive. By the middle of
September, the company was adding 35 new members a week.


### An inconvenient discovery
- By the middle of October, with 10 cars on the road and over 400 members and just a couple of weeks
before the company would close on its first round of funding, Chase believed there would be
sufficient data to see if the business model was sound. With help from Jim Grube, an MIT student
who was getting his master’s in transportation, Chase pored over the numbers.
- Car utilization was only 22%, much lower than the 40% she
had estimated. In other words, in a 24-hour day, cars were being used less than 5.5 hours a day as
opposed to 9.6 hours. Revenue per trip was about half of what she had predicted. Somewhere, amidst
her modeling, she had made a miscalculation with the math.
- After looking at the numbers, Chase was able to determine that the daily rate was the
culprit. Much to her discomfort, the math indicated that with 50% of revenue coming from daily
rentals, a higher percentage than she had predicted, the daily rate would have to go up by 20% in
order to break even.
- Adjusting the prices
would take a lot of back-end engineering time.
Not everyone agreed that raising prices was the right move or that it was the right time to do so.
- Furthermore, the point was made that such a price hike could result in a customer backlash right as
the company was set to close on its Series A financing.
- As Chase listened to Mark and other members of her team share their reservations toward the idea of
raising prices, she started to get angry: “As I was sitting there I began to think, I’ve heard so many
CEOs talk about their startup experience. And none of them, not one, had ever said that this would
happen. I had been told no stories at all about it being hard. I just thought, wow, you’ve all been such
liars, and no one ever let on about this. This was the big secret, and it was awful.”


### Challenges 
<details>
<summary>
How would you redesign Zipcar’s pricing strategy to optimize for both utilization and profitability while maintaining customer satisfaction?
</summary>
I like Chase's strategy of covering the fixed costs via hourly and daily rates, while the mileage cost was to cover the variable cost (maintenance and fuel). But I feel that the issue that Chase faced with the pricing strategy was due to the low pricing strategy of her annual budget especially due to low number of subscribers initially, however I feel this would have been a great strategy had there been more annual subscribers. So for low number of subscribers initially I feel a better pricing strategy would be to apply peak timings like Weekday mornings (7 AM–10 AM) and evenings (5 PM–8 PM), as most people commute to work , to show higher pricing and off-peak pricing for late nights or holidays to show low pricing.The pricing could be hiked by 10% and lowered by 15%, this would not only force users to chose zipcar during peak times but also chose it during holidays and other timings.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What key assumptions about customer behavior and market demand did Zipcar get wrong, and how could they have been validated earlier?
</summary>
Chase estimated that cars would be utilized 40% of the time, but actual utilization was only 22% (5.5 hours/day instead of 9.6 hours/day). Offering different pricing structures in different areas and analyzing the results could have revealed the reliance on daily rentals earlier. She assumed uniform usage but did not implement pricing strategies to drive demand during off-peak hours. To better predict demand, she should have studied car usage trends and introduced calibrated pricing strategies, such as peak vs. off-peak rates or weekday discounts, to optimize revenue. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What strategies would you use to scale Zipcar efficiently while ensuring competitive differentiation from rental companies like Hertz or emerging ride-hailing services?
</summary>
The one thing that differentiates Zipcar from other brands is the personal touch that lacks in the big companies. Effective flow of communication between the company and its users is essential and can be a great part of a success. Like sending regular emails, special campaigns can also be created to cater to different users for example students or office employees etc. by giving them redeemable awards, or student discounts. Another differentiation could be created by increasing the service base to not only commute the people but also goods, which could be a huge help to the peeople who need to send the goods on regular basis and they can be a huge part of increasing the customer base and revenue of zipcar.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
How would you communicate and implement a 20% price increase without losing customer trust and engagement?
</summary>
The best way to implement a price increase is through honest and transparent communication. Instead of customers waking up to higher prices, we’d clearly explain the reason for the increase. For example, we’d highlight that the price hike will allow us to add more cars to the fleet, offering more convenience and better service. We’d also mention upcoming improvements, such as upgraded RFID cards for quicker access and the introduction of loyalty points that can be redeemed for free rides. Additionally, we'd remind customers that discounts will always be available to them, ensuring continued value for their membership.
